This part is adapted from [Potree v1.7](https://github.com/potree/potree/tree/1.7) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).
# Demo
You can visit a demo of the current version [here](https://qiweishen.github.io/potree-lasso-selection.io/). ATTENTION: There is no point cloud object example loaded in the online demo (will be solved soon), but the lasso function is fully enabled.
